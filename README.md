## Logistic mixed-effects model analysis with pseudo-observations for estimating risk ratios in clustered binary data analysis

The modified Poisson and linear regression analyses have been standard methods for multivariate analyses of binary outcome data in estimating risk ratio and risk difference. Uno, Noma and Gosho (2024+) <forthcoming> show these multivariate analyses possibly provide biased and/or imprecise estimates under small and sparse data situations (i.e., the “separation” condition). This package provides computational tools of the Firth-type penalized estimating methods for the modified Poisson and linear regressions proposed by Uno, Noma and Gosho (2024+) <forthcoming>. Also, a bias-corrected sandwich variance estimator under small sample settings is available.
